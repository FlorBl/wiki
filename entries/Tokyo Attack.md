##Tokyo Attack



At around 8 p.m. JST on 31 October 2021, a man carried out a knife and arson attack on a Tokyo subway train as it was travelling to Kokury Station on the Kei Line in Chfu, a city in the western suburbs of Tokyo, Japan.[2][3] He injured 17 people, one critically.[2][3] The man, identified as 24-year-old Kyota Hattori, was arrested at the scene.[2][3]







Incident



The attack began as a man reportedly sprayed pesticide into the eyes of the man sitting next to him on the train, before stabbing him in the chest. He then moved to another car and spread lighter fluid across the car in order to start a fire.[4] Some of the passengers thought the attacker was part of a Halloween stunt, until other passengers began fleeing and he began waving a long bloody knife.[5]







As the Express train passed through Fuda Station, one of the passengers pressed the emergency alarm; in response, the train planned to make an emergency stop at Kokury Station. While the train was approaching Kokury Station, the emergency door release handle was pulled, causing the train to stop 2 to 3 meters before its proper parking position. As the train was coming to a stop, footage recorded by a passenger showed other passengers fleeing to one end of the train as the fire ignited by the attacker erupted in one of the cars. After the train had come to a stop, passengers opened the train's windows and climbed out to escape.[6]







Suspect



After being arrested, the 24-year-old suspect was identified as Kyota Hattori. He allegedly told officers that he wanted to die after he had work problems in June 2021 and was no longer getting along with his friends. He allegedly stated that if he had killed at least two people, he would receive the death penalty.[4]







Several media outlets noted that the man was dressed in clothing that appeared similar to that of the Joker character from the Batman franchise.[2]
