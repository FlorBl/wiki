A delivery drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used to transport packages, medical supplies, food, or other goods. Delivery drones are typically autonomous. In November 2020 the FAA proposed airworthiness criteria for type certification of delivery drones with an intent to initialize commercial operations. Zipline, Wingcopter, and Amazon Prime Air were amongst the 10 companies selected for this type certification.[2]


Healthcare delivery

In December 2013, the DHL parcel service subsidiary of Deutsche Post AG tested a "microdrones md4-1000" for delivery of medicine.
Drones can be used to transport medicinal products such as blood products, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and medical samples.[medical citation needed] Medical deliveries are able to fly into and out of remote or otherwise inaccessible regions, compared to trucks or motorcycles.[3] Medical drone delivery is credited with saving lives during emergency deliveries of blood in Rwanda and post-hurricane relief in Puerto Rico.[4]

During the COVID-19 pandemic, drones made medical deliveries of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests in the United States[5], Israel,[6] and Ghana.[7][8] In partnership with the Ghana Ministry of Health, Zipline drones delivered thousands of COVID-19 vaccine vials in Ghana during 2020 and 2021.[9][10].University of British Columbia (UBC) has. selected Drone Delivery Canada Corp for UBC's Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative program. This solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellaten First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia. Also, to add further in 2021 the first BVLOS drone medical delivery trials in India was conducted at Gauribidanur taluk of Chikkaballapur district on the outskirts of Bangalore in Karnataka, India[11].

Food delivery
Drones have been proposed as a solution for rapidly delivering prepared foods, such as pizzas, tacos, and frozen beverages.

Early prototypes of food delivery drones include the Tacocopter demonstration by Star Simpson, which was a taco delivery concept utilizing a smartphone app to order drone-delivered tacos in San Francisco area.[12] The revelation that it didn't exist as a delivery system or app led to it being labelled a hoax.[12][13][14]A similar concept named the "burrito bomber" was tested in 2012.[15]

Postal delivery
Different postal companies from Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom[16] and Ukraine have undertaken various drone trials as they test the feasibility and profitability of unmanned delivery drone services.[17] The USPS has been testing delivery systems[18] with HorseFly Drones.

Ship resupply
The shipping line Maersk and the Port of Rotterdam have experimented with using drones to resupply offshore ships instead of sending smaller boats.[19]

Regulation
Further information: Regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles
In February 2014, the prime minister and cabinet affairs minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that the UAE planned to launch a fleet of UAVs for civilian purposes.[20] Plans were for the UAVs to use fingerprint and eye-recognition systems to deliver official documents such as passports, ID cards and licenses, and supply emergency services at accidents. A battery-powered prototype four-rotor UAV about half a meter across was displayed in Dubai.[21]

In the United States, initial attempts at commercial use of UAVs were blocked by FAA regulation, but were later allowed. In June 2014, the FAA published a document that listed activities not permitted under its regulations, including commercial use, which the organization stated included "delivering packages to people for a fee" or offered as part of a "purchase or another offer."[22] The agency issued waivers to many organizations for less restrictive commercial uses, but each had to apply individually. In August 2016, the FAA adopted Part 107 rules[23] that allowed limited commercial use by right. Drone operation under these rules is restricted to line-of-sight of the pilot and is not allowed over people, implying many applications like delivery to populated areas still requires a waiver. They also require the UAVs weigh less than 55 lb (25 kg), fly up to a maximum of 400 feet (120 m), at a speed of no greater than 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), only be operated during daytime, and that drone operators must also qualify for flying certificates and be at least 16 years old.[24] In 2019, the FAA began certifying drone delivery companies under conventional charter airline Part 135 rules, with some accommodations for drones (such as that the pilot manual did not need to be carried on board). In preparation for higher volumes of drone traffic, the FAA finalized the Remote ID regulation in December 2020, giving manufacturers 18 months and operators 30 months to comply with the requirement for self-identification transmissions outside of designated areas. At the same time, the FAA added a Operations Over People and at Night rule to Part 107. Nighttime operations require anti-collision lights and additional pilot training. For flight over people or moving vehicles, drones are put into four categories depending on capability of injury to people, with the least restricted category having a full Part 21 airworthiness certificate.[25]

Early Experiments
2013-2015
The concept of drone delivery entered the mainstream with Amazon Prime Air  Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' December 2013 announcement that Amazon was planning rapid delivery of lightweight commercial products using UAVs. Amazon's press release was met with skepticism, with perceived hurdles including federal and state regulatory approval, public safety, reliability, individual privacy, operator training and certification, security (hacking), payload thievery, and logistical challenges.[26]

In December 2013, in a research project of Deutsche Post AG subsidiary DHL, a sub-kilogram quantity of medicine was delivered via a prototype Microdrones "Parcelcopter", raising speculation that disaster relief may be the first industry the company will use the technology.[27][28]

In July 2014 it was revealed Amazon was working on its 8th and 9th drone prototypes where each could fly 50 mph (80 km/h) and carry a 5 lb (2.3 kg) package, and had applied to the FAA to test them.[29]

In August 2014, Google revealed it had been testing UAVs in Australia for two years. The Google X program known as "Project Wing" announced an aim to produce drones that can deliver products sold via e-commerce.[30]

In September 2014, FedEx was reportedly testing integration of drone delivery with their existing logistics model.[31]

In February 2015, Hangzhou-based e-commerce provider Ali Baba started delivery drone service in a partnership with Shanghai YTO Express in which it delivered tea to 450 customers around select cities in China.[32]

In 2015, an Israeli startup Flytrex partnered with AHA,[33] Iceland's largest eCommerce website, and together they initiated a drone delivery route which demonstrated reducing delivery time from 30 minutes, to less than 5 minutes.[34][35]

2016-2018
In March 2016, Flirtey conducted the first fully autonomous FAA approved drone delivery in an urban setting in the U.S.[36]

In April 2016, a joint project in Japan involving the central government, Chiba City, research institutions and companies including Rakuten was launched to trial home drone deliveries in an urban area. A similar test project was carried out in Naka, Tokushima in February 2016 as a way to facilitate shopping for people who live in a depopulated area.[37]

A partnership between 7-Eleven and Flirtey resulted in the first FAA-approved delivery to a residence in the United States in July 2016, delivering a frozen Slurpee.[38] The following month, the company partnered with Domino's in New Zealand to launch the first commercial drone delivery service.[39][40]

In December 2016, Amazon Prime Air made its first delivery using a drone in the United Kingdom.[41]

In China, JD.com has been developing drone delivery capabilities. As of June 2017, JD.com had seven different types of delivery drones in testing across four provinces in China (Beijing, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Jiangsu). The drones are capable of delivering packages weighing between 5 and 30 kg (11 to 66 lbs) while flying up to 100 km/hr (62 mph). The drones fly along fixed routes from warehouses to special landing pads where one of JD.com's 300,000 local contractors then delivers the packages to the customers doorsteps in the rural villages. The e-commerce giant is also working on a 1 metric ton (1,000 kg) delivery drone which will be tested in Shaanxi.[42]

In January 2018, Boeing unveiled a prototype of a cargo drone for up to 500 lb (227 kg) payloads, an electric flying testbed that completed flight tests at the Boeing Research & Technology research center in Missouri.[43]
